    sanrenottl: 'The She-Wolf of Rome',
    sanrenodesc: `On the banks of the Tiber, a basket drifted ashore carrying two abandoned infants — Romulus and Remus, sons of Mars and the priestess Rhea Silvia. Meant to die, they were saved by fate.
A she-wolf, hearing their cries, found the twins. Instead of harming them, she nursed them as her own. Later, a shepherd named Faustulus discovered the boys and raised them with his wife.
When grown, the brothers chose to found a city. Quarrels arose, and Romulus killed Remus, becoming Rome’s first king. From that tragedy was born the Eternal City, forever watched over by the symbol of the she-wolf.`,

Today, the ruins stand as a silent echo of those roars, reminding us of both Rome’s grandeur and its darker thirst for spectacle.`,
